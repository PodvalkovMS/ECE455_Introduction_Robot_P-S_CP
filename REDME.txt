Matlab code framefind.m read file in the same folder object.key and robot.key and create Hermit polynomials for 2 pont to find a frame between key frame and write answer in file robot/robot.ang and object/object.traj 
1)
A) framefind.m
b) the function to create polynomials and understanding how to create polynomials and what need to do
c) code can be optimized by 
1) use loop for 1 to t only once and execute all function inside it
2) if we use the same key frame and change t part of code can be precalculated such as polynomials
